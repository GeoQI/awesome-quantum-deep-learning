A curated list of study materials , discussion forums and ideas about the huge emerging topic

### why and what is deep learning?
##### In one line , If you know deep learning you can get a good job :) ,Even a different platform undergraduated and graduated person done a master specialization in deep learning can work in this big sector :), Practically speaking machine learning (vector mathematics) , deep learning (vector space mathematics) and big data are the terms created by big companies to make a trend in the market ,but in science and research there is no word such that , Now a days if you ask a junior person working in this big companies ,what is deep learning ,you will get some reply as "doing linear regression with stochastic gradient for a unsupervised data using Convolutional Neural Network :)" ,They knows the words clearly and knows how to do programming using that on a bunch of "relative data" , If you ask them about the FCM , SVM and HMM etc algorithms ,they will simply say these are olden days algorithms , deep learning replaced all :),  But actually they dont know from the birth to the till level and the effectiveness of algorithms and mathematics ,How many mathematical theorems in vector, spaces , tensors etc solved to find this "hiding the complexity technology", They did not played with real non relative data like medical images, astro images , geology images etc , finding a relation and features is really complex and looping over n number of images to do pattern matching is a giant work , Now a days the items mentioned as deep learning (= multiple hidden artifical neural network) is not suitable for that

### why quantum deep learning or deep quantum learning?
##### In the mid of Artificial Neural Network Research people realised at the maximum extreme only certain mathematical operations possible to do with ANN and the aim of this ANN is to achieve parallel execution of many mathematical operations , In artificial Intelligence ,the world intelligence stands for mathematics ,how effective if a probem can be solvable is based on the mathematics logic applying on the problem , more the logic will give more performance(more intelligent), This goal open the gate for quantum artificial neural network, On applying the ideas behind the deep learning to quantum mechanics environment, its possible to apply complex mathematical equations to n number of non relational data to find more features and can improve the performance
